        <h2>Inspired by Two Very Spoiled Dogs</h2>
        <p>
            The Polo and Prince Foundation was born out of love — for our two pups, and for every dog that deserves the same joy.
             While we're still getting things ready, our goal is simple: to build a platform that helps shelter and street dogs 
             find homes where they’ll be spoiled, safe, and deeply loved — just like Polo and Prince.
